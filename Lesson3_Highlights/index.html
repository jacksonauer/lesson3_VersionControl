            <p class="lead">Until we started this assignment, I had absolutely no idea what a version control system was, what it could do, or why one would be so useful. I had, however, heard of GitHub. I had no idea what it did, but I had heard of it. Now that I know what a VCS is I couldn’t imagine not using one from here on out. I like to design websites in my free time and currently and in the past have made websites for clients so, upon hearing of version control systems, I will definitely be implementing them in my process in the future. Their ability to keep records of changes to a file or set of files over time in order to have the ability to be able to recall specific versions later is unparalleled.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It is very impressive that the DVCS that we are using was built by the very operating system that it runs on, Linux. Not only was it built by people who work for and with Linux, but by the creator of Linux itself, Linus Torvalds. When the relationship with Bitkeeper, the DVCS that the Linux operating system was originally working with, broke down, Linux jumped at the opportunity to create their own DVCS that was speedy, simple, and fully distributed. Thus, GitHub was born in 2005 and remains one of the foremost DVCS’s on the market. Not to mention, it’s free!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The simplicity of Git is unreal. There are essentially three main states your files can be in while being worked on in Git and three main sections of a Git project. These are committed, modified, and staged and the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area respectively. Working in Git is an easy to remember, repetitive process. You modify files in your local system or working tree, then you stage the files in the staging area, adding snapshots of them to your staging area. Finally, you do a commit, which takes the files and stores them permanently in your Git directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A CVS enables users around the world to work on files and coding projects together. GitHub endows the user with very easy-to-use commands that can recall status updates about certain lines of code or actions that have recently happened in the shared files. All you need to do is enter git status into the console and you will get a status of the recent updates of the file. Another useful thing you can do, when working collaboratively, is use the git blame command. If you see a line of code and you want to know who wrote it, whether it’s because you love it or because you want to know if the author was out of his mind while writing it, if you use git blame and call a certain line of code, it will tell you exactly who wrote it. You can additionally figure out the time and date of when they wrote that line.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why Even Use a VCS?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So let’s go back. Why even use a VCS in the first place? Well, without a CVS, the only ways to save multiple versions of the same file is to either save different files with different filenames or overwrite files with no ability to get the old version of the file back. When editing files in a DVCS, you are able to revert to old versions of a file whenever you want to simply by checking a file out of the remote server, pulling it to your local server, and then checking it by back in by pushing it back to the remote server. You can also work collaboratively with people from anywhere without having to archaically email the file back and forth. You can simply pull the file from the same remote database and check it back in, with each collaborative member having the ability to see the updates made to each file.</p>
